# HangMan

In this project, users will have to guess a word, letter by letter.

The word is randomly selected from Google's 10,000 most common words.

The user has a maximum number of wrong guesses allowed. Once they hit that mark, they lose.

The library I used in this project was the 'random' library.

The word is stored, letter by letter, in an array. I did this because I could remove letters that have already been correctly guessed, and move them to an array, by position, that shows the users progress.

Thank you for checking out my project!
